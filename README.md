# Diabetes Prediction App with Keras + Streamlit

This app predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user-input health data using a trained neural network.

This is a real-time **Diabetes Prediction Web App** built using:

- **Keras (TensorFlow backend)** for deep learning
- **Streamlit** for interactive UI
- **SHAP** for model explainability

## Features

1. Clean data preprocessing pipeline  
2. Deep learning model with Keras  
3. Real-time prediction based on user input  
4. SHAP waterfall + bar plots for model explainability  
5. Confusion matrix, classification report, AUC score  
6. Responsive UI built with Streamlit  

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `streamlit run app.py`
